Short description:
I made a twitter bot that makes your tweets into fractals.

Annotation:
Tweets are short, but can pack a lot of meaning. Like a fractal. How would it look if we took the tweet as a recursive rulesystem that makes fractals out of them? Retweet a tweet you would like to see @tweet2fractal to view the fractal! Some can be interesting. Some are not. Like tweets.


Controls:
Retweet your favorite tweet with a @tweet2fractal mention. Latest retweeted tweet will be displayed on tweet2fractal.herokuapp.com and all of them you can find on twitter @tweet2fractal.
